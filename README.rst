README
======

Document covering my dotfile repo.

Todo
----

#. Create folder with dotfiles, under version control
#. Can keep dotfiles in subdirectories to make less cluttered.
   E.g. ones for ``vim``, ``bash``, ``git``, etc.
#. Create an *idempotent* install script which creates symlinks
   to these dotfiles in the correct locations on the filesystems.
   This will probably be a bash shell script.
